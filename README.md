# Basic Data Visualization with Python
This repo includes a presentation that I made to go over some basic of data visualization using some common python tools.
Accompanying the presentation are two sets of notebooks, some empty and some completed. The thought is that using the presentation, google, and the completed notebooks as a reference people can complete the empty notebooks.

## Getting Started
This repo contains a pipfile so that it can easily be set up if using the pipenv virtual environment. To run it, install dependencies, and load the notebooks run:
```
pipenv shell
pipenv install
jupyter notebook
```
